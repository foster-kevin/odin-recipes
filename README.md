This project will involve making a website with a homepage linking to several recipes.  This will reflect my knowledge of how to:

1. Create an html boilerplate
2. Use basic html elements (titles, headings, paragraphs, lists)
3. Use html element attributes to create absolute and/or relative hyperlinks and images
4. Utilize git & github
5. Comment code and git commits
